"""Pure-ASGI variant of the security middleware.

`PureASGISecurityMiddleware` runs the same request-screening pipeline as
`SecurityMiddleware` (initialization, CORS preflight, path exclusions, IP
extraction, ban lists, rate limiting, user-agent blocking, penetration
detection, behavioral usage rules) without inheriting from Starlette's
`BaseHTTPMiddleware`.

Why it exists: `BaseHTTPMiddleware` wraps the downstream app in an anyio
task group whose cancel scope cancels in-flight downstream awaits (database
calls, long LLM streams) when a client disconnects mid-request. Framework
projects that ban `BaseHTTPMiddleware` for exactly this reason (open-webui
is one) can mount this variant instead and keep the same guard behavior.

Response-side differences from `SecurityMiddleware`:

- Security headers and CORS response headers are injected directly on the
  `http.response.start` message; responses stream through unbuffered.
- Per-request metrics (request count, response time, error rate) are
  emitted once the downstream app finishes the response. Response time is
  measured until the response starts, the same as the classic middleware.
- Decorator-driven response rules (return patterns) and
  `custom_response_modifier` need a materialized `Response` object and are
  only applied by the `BaseHTTPMiddleware`-based middleware.

The downstream app receives a replaying receive channel, so both guard and
the application can read the request body.
