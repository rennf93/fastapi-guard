## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository

2. The project uses Docker for development and testing. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

3. You can use the provided Makefile commands to set up your development environment:

```bash
# Install dependencies using 'uv'
make install

# For development, you can run the example app
make start-example

# To stop all containers
make stop
```

## Testing

The project supports Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13. Tests are run using Docker containers:

```bash
# Run tests with the default Python version (3.10)
make test

# Run tests with all supported Python versions
make test-all

# Run tests with a specific Python version
make test-3.11

# Run tests locally (if you have 'uv' installed)
make local-test
```

## Style Guidelines

This project uses:
- [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for code formatting and linting
- [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking

Before submitting a PR, make sure your code passes all style checks:

```bash
make lint
```
