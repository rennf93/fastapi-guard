# Security Monitoring

FastAPI Guard provides robust security logging capabilities that can be leveraged for monitoring and analytics. This guide covers how to work with the logs generated by FastAPI Guard and options for deeper security analytics.

## Basic Logging

By default, FastAPI Guard logs all security events to standard Python logging facilities. You can configure custom log paths using the `custom_log_file` parameter in the `SecurityConfig`.

```python
config = SecurityConfig(
    ipinfo_token="your_ipinfo_token_here",
    custom_log_file="/path/to/security.log"
)
```

## Passive Mode for Penetration Detection

When deploying in production environments, it's often best to start with passive mode to understand your traffic patterns before enabling blocking rules.

```python
config = SecurityConfig(
    ipinfo_token="your_ipinfo_token_here",
    enable_penetration_detection=True,
    passive_mode=True  # Log but don't block
)
```

In passive mode, FastAPI Guard will detect potential penetration attempts, but instead of blocking the request, it will only log the incident with the prefix `[PASSIVE MODE]` in your logs. This helps identify false positives before enabling full blocking mode.

## Log Analysis

FastAPI Guard logs contain valuable security intelligence, including:

- IP addresses attempting suspicious actions
- Pattern matches indicating attack vectors (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Geographic origins of traffic
- Rate limiting violations
- Cloud provider origins

You can use standard log analysis tools to process and visualize these logs.
