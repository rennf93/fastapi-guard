WebSockets
==========

`SecurityMiddleware` protects HTTP requests only. It is built on Starlette's `BaseHTTPMiddleware`, which never runs its `dispatch` method for a `"websocket"` ASGI scope; a `@app.websocket` route registered on the same app receives zero protection from the middleware, regardless of configuration.

___

The guard_websocket Dependency
-------------------------------

Secure a WebSocket route explicitly with `Depends(guard_websocket)`:

```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, WebSocket

from guard import SecurityConfig, SecurityMiddleware, guard_websocket

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(
    SecurityMiddleware,
    config=SecurityConfig(
        trusted_proxies=["10.0.0.1"],
        blacklist=("203.0.113.9",),
    ),
)


@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(
    websocket: WebSocket, _: None = Depends(guard_websocket)
) -> None:
    await websocket.accept()
    await websocket.send_text("connected")
```

`guard_websocket` runs before the route function, using the same `SecurityConfig` passed to `app.add_middleware(SecurityMiddleware, config=...)`. In order, it checks:

1. `ip_ban_manager.is_ip_banned` -- is the resolved client IP currently banned.
2. `is_ip_allowed` -- whitelist/blacklist, blocked countries, blocked cloud providers.
3. `check_rate_limit_by_ip` -- a rate-limit bucket isolated from the HTTP pipeline's own bucket for the same IP (keyed by `endpoint_path="ws"`), Redis-backed when `enable_redis=True`, in-memory otherwise.

On the first failing check, the connection is closed with WebSocket close code `1008` (Policy Violation) before `accept()` is ever called; the client sees the handshake rejected, not an accepted-then-closed connection.

If Redis is unreachable while `ip_ban_manager.is_ip_banned` or `check_rate_limit_by_ip` runs, `guard_websocket` follows the same `redis_fail_open` and `fail_secure` rules as the HTTP pipeline: `redis_fail_open=True` skips the failing check and treats it as passed; otherwise `fail_secure=True` (the default) refuses the handshake with close code `1013` (Try Again Later); otherwise the check is skipped and the error is logged.

A client that passes `is_ip_allowed` while a global `SecurityConfig.whitelist` is configured is, by construction, a member of that whitelist; the rate-limit check is skipped for it entirely, mirroring the HTTP pipeline's own rule that a whitelisted request never reaches `RateLimitCheck`. A non-whitelisted client is still rejected by the allow-list check itself, before rate limiting would ever run.

___

The make_guard_websocket Factory
---------------------------------

`make_guard_websocket(config: SecurityConfig)` returns a dependency bound to that exact `SecurityConfig`, independent of `SecurityMiddleware` registration. It runs the identical checks as `guard_websocket`, in the same order, sharing one private implementation, so it is not a reduced or divergent code path -- it is the same guard, given its config directly instead of resolving it from the middleware.

This is useful for a WebSocket route on an app that has no `SecurityMiddleware` at all (an app that guards WebSocket traffic only), or in tests that want to exercise the guard without standing up the full HTTP middleware:

```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, WebSocket

from guard import SecurityConfig, make_guard_websocket

app = FastAPI()

config = SecurityConfig(blacklist=("203.0.113.9",))


@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(
    websocket: WebSocket, _: None = Depends(make_guard_websocket(config))
) -> None:
    await websocket.accept()
    await websocket.send_text("connected")
```

`guard_websocket` keeps its existing contract: it still raises `RuntimeError` at connection time on an app without a registered `SecurityMiddleware`, even if `make_guard_websocket` is used elsewhere on that same app.

___

Redis-Backed Rate Limiting
----------------------------

`RedisManager` is a process-wide singleton; constructing one with a different `SecurityConfig` rebinds the connection for every other caller in the process, including the HTTP pipeline. Neither `guard_websocket` nor `make_guard_websocket` ever constructs a `RedisManager` themselves.

`guard_websocket` resolves the already-initialized manager that `SecurityMiddleware` created for the same `SecurityConfig`; if `enable_redis=True` but that manager has not connected yet, the rate-limit check falls back to the in-memory store for that connection rather than forcing a connection or touching the singleton.

`make_guard_websocket(config, redis_handler=None)` takes the manager explicitly instead: pass an already-initialized `RedisManager` to back the websocket rate limit with Redis, or leave it `None` to use the in-memory store. Passing `enable_redis=True` with no `redis_handler` logs one warning when the dependency is created (not on every connection) and then rate-limits in memory for the lifetime of that dependency:

```python
from guard import SecurityConfig, make_guard_websocket
from guard_core.handlers.redis_handler import RedisManager

config = SecurityConfig(redis_url="redis://localhost:6379", enable_redis=True)
redis_handler = RedisManager(config)
await redis_handler.initialize()

dependency = make_guard_websocket(config, redis_handler=redis_handler)
```

___

Client Resolution
------------------

The client IP is resolved the same way as the HTTP pipeline: `websocket.client.host` if the connection has a peer, or `X-Forwarded-For` when the connecting peer is a trusted proxy (`trusted_proxies`, `trusted_proxy_depth`). A connection with no peer at all (a Unix domain socket, some serverless adapters) needs `"unix"` in `trusted_proxies` to resolve from `X-Forwarded-For`, exactly as for HTTP; see [Proxy Security](security/proxy-security.md#unix-sockets-and-serverless-adapters).

When the client address still cannot be resolved, `guard_websocket` follows the same `fail_secure` setting as the HTTP pipeline: `fail_secure=True` (the default) closes the connection with code `1008` before running any further check; `fail_secure=False` runs the ban, allow-list, and blocked-country checks against identity `"unknown"` (allowed unless a whitelist or a country allow-list is configured) and skips the rate-limit check, since there is no real IP to key a rate-limit bucket on.

___

Close Code Contract
--------------------

`guard` exports module-level `(code, reason)` constants for every close outcome `guard_websocket`/`make_guard_websocket` can emit, and neither ever raises any pair outside this set. Log processing can key on the `reason` string directly, or import the constants:

```python
from guard import (
    WS_CLOSE_CLIENT_ADDRESS_UNKNOWN,
    WS_CLOSE_IP_BANNED,
    WS_CLOSE_IP_NOT_ALLOWED,
    WS_CLOSE_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED,
    WS_CLOSE_REASONS,
    WS_CLOSE_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILED,
    WebSocketCloseReason,
)
```

Each constant is a `WebSocketCloseReason(code, reason)` named tuple; `WS_CLOSE_REASONS` collects all five.

| Code | Reason                                    | Cause                                                     |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1008 | `IP banned`                                | `ip_ban_manager.is_ip_banned` returned `True`.              |
| 1008 | `IP not allowed`                           | `is_ip_allowed` returned `False` (whitelist/blacklist, blocked country, blocked cloud provider). |
| 1008 | `Rate limit exceeded`                      | `check_rate_limit_by_ip` returned `False`.                  |
| 1008 | `Client address could not be determined`   | No resolvable client identity and `fail_secure=True`.       |
| 1013 | `Security check failed`                    | A Redis error during the ban or rate-limit check, with `redis_fail_open=False` and `fail_secure=True`. |

Every close in this table happens before `accept()`, so the `reason` string reaches the server's own logs only, not the browser: uvicorn answers a pre-accept close with plain HTTP `403` and discards the WebSocket close code and reason entirely (uvicorn's `websockets_impl.py:296-303`), so the client sees a failed upgrade with status `403`, never the `(code, reason)` pair. Read the pair in the application's own logging, for example a handler around `WebSocketException`, not on the client.

A Redis failure during `ip_ban_manager.is_ip_banned` follows `redis_fail_open` and `fail_secure` exactly as described above: with `redis_fail_open=False` and `fail_secure=False`, the failure is treated as "not banned", the same fail-open default the HTTP pipeline uses for this case; only `fail_secure=True` produces the `1013` close.

What `check_rate_limit_by_ip` does with a Redis failure depends on the guard-core version. With guard-core older than 3.15.0 it catches the error internally, logs it on every request, and falls back to the same per-process in-memory window used when `enable_redis=False`, on both the HTTP pipeline and here; it never raises, so the `1013` close is reachable only through the ban check. From guard-core 3.15.0 it follows `redis_fail_open`: with `redis_fail_open=False` (the default) a Redis failure raises `GuardRedisError`, which under `fail_secure=True` becomes a 500 on the HTTP pipeline and the `1013` close here, and is passed through otherwise; with `redis_fail_open=True` the in-memory fallback is kept and the failure is logged once per process instead of on every request. In either case, while the fallback is active with more than one worker process, the effective limit is `rate_limit` multiplied by the worker count, since each process counts independently.

___

Client IP on websocket.state
------------------------------

Immediately after the client identity is resolved, and before any check runs, `guard_websocket` and `make_guard_websocket` set `websocket.state.client_ip` to that resolved value -- including the literal string `"unknown"` when no client address could be determined and `fail_secure=False` let the connection proceed. A route handler can read `websocket.state.client_ip` after `accept()` to log or reuse the identity the guard already resolved, without re-deriving it from headers.

___

Scope
-----

`guard_websocket` does not run penetration detection, security headers, HTTPS enforcement, or any per-route decorator; those are HTTP-pipeline concepts with no WebSocket equivalent. It requires `SecurityMiddleware` to already be registered on the app (`app.add_middleware(SecurityMiddleware, config=...)`); calling it without that raises `RuntimeError` at connection time.
