- Improved timestamp tracking for more accurate request counting
- Fixed edge cases in rate limiting that could cause unexpected 429 errors

## v2.0.0 (2025-05-05)

### Security Fixes
- **IMPORTANT**: Fixed Remote Header Injection vulnerability via X-Forwarded-For manipulation (GHSA-77q8-qmj7-x7pp)
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-46814
- Added secure client IP extraction with trusted proxy validation
- Added new configuration parameters for proxy security:
  - `trusted_proxies`: List of trusted proxy IPs or CIDR ranges
  - `trusted_proxy_depth`: Configurable proxy chain depth
  - `trust_x_forwarded_proto`: Option to trust X-Forwarded-Proto header

### New Features
- IPInfo is now completely optional, you can implement your own `GeoIPHandler`
- Added protocol-based design for customizable geographical IP handling
- Introduced `GeoIPHandler` protocol allowing custom implementations
- Separated protocol definitions into dedicated modules

## v1.5.0 (2025-05-01)
### Improvements
- IpInfo token is now only required when using country filtering or cloud blocking
- Performance: Selective loading of IP geolocation database and cloud IP ranges
- Only download/process IP geolocation data when country filtering is configured
- Only fetch cloud provider IP ranges when cloud blocking is enabled
- Reduced startup time and memory usage when not using all security features

## v1.4.0 (2025-04-30)
### New Features
- Added configurable logging levels for normal and suspicious requests
- Enhanced log_activity function to support all logging levels

## v1.3.2 (2025-04-27)
### New Features
- Created an interactive [FastAPI Guard Playground](https://playground.fastapi-guard.com)

- Enhanced `remove_pattern()` method to return success/failure status

### Improvements
- Fixed issue with default pattern removal in `SusPatternsManager`
- Improved pattern separation between default and custom patterns

## v1.2.0 (2025-04-04)
### New Features
